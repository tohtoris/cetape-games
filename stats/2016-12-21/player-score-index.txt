This graph displays a so called score index which is an inter-match comparable value derived from player scores. It describes the scoring tendency of a player. It is a RELATIVE value, NOT absolute. The problem with the raw player score is that it is not comparable between matches. Player scores of match are affected by many factors, such as the number of players, the map, the team and the match duration. Score index is comparable score descriptor which takes the match duration and the number of players into consideration; it is defined as the amount of score points in a 1 hour long match with 1 player. It does not take the map nor the team into account, but it's quite reasonable to assume that those variables do not play key role because all players tend to play same maps over and over again and each map is usually played twice with switched teams.
